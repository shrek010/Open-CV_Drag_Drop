# Open-CV_Drag_Drop
 Computer Vision Project: Object Manipulation with Hand Detection.
A system that enables users to control and manipulate objects on screen simply by using
their index finger. Using MediaPipe's robust hand tracking capabilities, system is able to precisely
detect and track the movement of the index finger in real-time. Combining this with OpenCV's image
processing prowess, a seamless interaction between the hand gestures and the virtual objects is
developed.
